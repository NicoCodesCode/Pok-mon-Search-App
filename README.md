# Pokémon Search App  

This is an app to search information about any Pokémon!   
I used the **freeCodeCamp** API to fetch the data.  
I didn't focus too much on the design, but the functionality is there!   

To use it, follow the steps below:

1. **Clone the repository**  
   - Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. **Run the app**  
   - Open the `index.html` file with **Live Server**.

3. **Search Pokémon**  
   - Type the name or ID of a Pokémon to view its stats.

Check it out! (if you want to, if not, it's probably fine).
